# Scrapiing_circ_info
Hi Everyone!
I made a project based on Web Scraping.Here I extracted teams data of cricket world  cup 2019 (Men's) Used the data to edit and design a template that I made... Explored and tried a few npm libraries. Learned about dependencies on other libraries. 
in this project, I learn about libraries how to implicate and ways of implicating libraries
I used libraries like PDF-LIB, EXCEL4NODE, AXIOS, etc. for more please follow the code

Had a lot of fun building this.
